# Ambiguous direction, ambiguous structure

The chart below is a representative sample of the average **Planter’s**  design. Participants in that group often expressed confusion about the open-ended strategy. “‘Food for everyone’...that's annoying” was a direct quote we heard alongside “should we throw them in with the rest of the designers?” These comments were not a coincidence.

People often default to their known, [past experience](https://duckduckgo.com) when faced with hard timelines, many options, and complex choices. For example, if I asked you to name a few job titles, you might say things like “marketer” or “accountant” because those are common words immediately available to you. We saw this defaulting behavior in both groups, but it was more pronounced in **Planter’s**. The evidence of Planter's more pronounced defaulting behavior lay in their arrangement of roles and their minimal use of creative latitude as afforded by the wildcards.

>“I know we can change titles but it's just a little unwieldy...I just like the idea of grouping these people together in the same place.” - Planter’s group 1

GH’s chart above is a good example of this bias. In their design, corporate functions are concentrated in one place and marketing is consolidated in two branches. The team under the [store] “Manager” is a large, monolithic structure of associates. All ten wildcards were used to fill a single role under inventory. Altogether, the structure doesn’t break the mold of your basic conception of a grocery store. Teams are not dedicated to any specific purpose outside of their skills affiliation.

Teams in the Planter’s cohort also found it difficult to rearrange staff and had higher incidents of collaborative friction. Farmer’s Table participants would develop their first branch of the organization chart within a few minutes, whereas Planter’s teams would take between 5 and 10 minutes, on average. 

Planter’s mission statement “Food for everyone”  did not give enough context or direction to develop strong collaborative flow. The consequence? Generic, administrative organization structures that might pass for a grocery store but leave a lot of creativity on the table.
